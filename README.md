Exercise 1:
Given the following dataset: avgHigh_jan_1895-2018.csv, perform Simple Linear Regression
using the first two columns of the dataset. Predict temperatures for the following three dates:
Jan 2019, Jan 2023, Jan 2024. You may use any built-in functions you wish.

Exercise 2:
Given the following dataset:avgHigh_jan_1895-2018.csv,split your data into training and test.
Perform Simple Linear Regression on the training dataset and use it to predict temperature
values for the test dataset.The test size should be provided as input by the user.Print the actual
temperatures from the test dataset aswell as the predicted values. Then, compute the Root
Mean Square Error(RMSE) between the actual temperatures and the predicted values from the test dataset.

 Exercise 3:
 Given the following dataset: materials.csv, compute the correlation coefficient, r, between
 the response variable, that is, Strength, and each of the predictor variables. Then,using Multiple Linear Regression, predict Strength for 
 the following two data points for Time, Pressure, Temperature, respectively:
 32.1,37.5,128.95
 36.9,35.37,130.03

 Exercise 4:
 Using the same dataset, and after retaining only the two features that correlate the most with
 the response variable, from Ex. 1, perform Multiple Linear Regression with those two features.
 Then, generate a 3D (meshgrid) plot to visualize the relationship between the two features and
 the response variable. On the same figure, also create a 3D scatter plot of the same independent
 and dependent variables.
